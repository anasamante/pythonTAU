"""Classes. - allows to group data and information like variables and functions into a single organized unit. - can
be organized one to a file, or multiple similar classes into the same file. Features - allow us to share information
with other classes and with other parts of the program. - inheritance which allow us to borrow from one class and use
its elements to create another one. - multiple inheritance which allows a class to inherit attributes from multiple
classes. - inherited or derived classes can override the parent classes - all classes in Python are Objects. -
information inside a class are usually functions, but can also contain variables that are specific to the class
and usable throughout the entire class. - instance variables  are specific to any Objects that are created by the
class.

The init method - allows every instance of a class to be initialized with specific parameters pre-determined at the
creation of that Object. - sets the attributes for the Object, the characteristics, the given parameters are
available to every class method.

The self variable - allows information to be shared easily and efficiently. - represents an instance of a class,
and it references the instance of the class that has been created. - We use self in order to make available all the
attributes to the methods throughout the class. - if a method is running as a part of the class rather than as an
instance of the class, then we do not need to use the self parameter in the method. """
